# Run Notebook on Your Local Machine

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/imsadia/cv-assignment-two.git
cd cv-assignment-one
```

Then download the zip file of required AffectNet dataset.
After unzipping zip file of dataset, you just need to provide your path to train set annotations and images directory, and test set annotations and image directory to extract the dataset through CustomDataset.

Now your are good to go! :thumbsup::wink:
